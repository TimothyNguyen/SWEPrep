Your API key is dd927d078678291d8efcf7381fe1.

The key you get here will be used to authorize you to access the partner 
and results APIs.

It’s your first day at a company, and you’re in charge of writing the 
logic to send invitations to a special two-day event in each country 
for the company’s partners in those countries. We need to find the 
dates that’ll work best based on survey results that partners have 
sent in and determine how many people can attend.

You’re provided with an API that gives you a list of partners, 
their countries, and which dates they’re available in ISO 8601 format.

Another team will send out the invitations, but you need to 
tell them when we should host the event and who should attend by 
POSTing to an API.

The date you send in for the country should be the starting date 
of the two day period where the most partners can make it for 
both days in a row. In case of multiple dates with the same 
number of partners, pick the earlier date. If there are no two 
days in a row when any partners can make it, return null.

            "attendeeCount": 0,
            "attendees": [],
            "name": "United States",
            "startDate": null
        },
