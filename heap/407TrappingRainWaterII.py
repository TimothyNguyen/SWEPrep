'''
The idea is that we maintain all the points of the current border in a min heap and always choose the point with the lowest length. This is actually an optimized searching strategy over the trivial brute force method: instead of dfs each point to find the lowest "border" of its connected component, we can always start a search from the lowest border and update the points adjacent to it.
